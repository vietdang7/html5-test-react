# HTML5 Test
The website is created for a HTML5 Test of Integrify programme. The question can be found [here](https://github.com/digiaonline/docs/tree/master/recruitment/html5)
This is the second version with some integration of React library.

## Example site:
[Deploy on Heroku](https://html5-test-vd.herokuapp.com/)

## Code Example
Here are some lines of example code:
1. index.js:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import 'font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css';


ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
2. app.js:
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Header from './components/header.js';
import Container from './components/container.js';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(){
    super();
    this.state = {
      partitions: []
    }
  }

  getPartitions(){
    this.setState(
      {
        partitions: [
          {
